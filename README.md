# Flatbox-LED-Pro-Shell
This is a reverse engineered shell for the Fightingbox Flatbox LED Pro (also known as the Bitfunx Flatbox).

I believe it should be compatable with the Flatbox LED shell if you remove the holes used for the three switches.

It is designed around and compatable with the Flatbox PCB marked as "Flatbox-LED-Pro-rev1.4".

Install the 7 M2x3 Threaded Inserts into the spots required and you should be good to go.
